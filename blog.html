    <h1>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1>
    <h3>var</h3>
    <h4>var

        Variables declared with var have either global or function scope.
        
        1.Global scope: A variable declared with var outside of any function is globally scoped. This means that it can be accessed from anywhere in your code. <br><br>
        2.Function scope: A variable declared with var inside of a function is function scoped. This means that it can be accessed from anywhere within that function, but not outside of it.
        </h4>
        <h3> Let</h3>
    <h4>

        Variables declared with let have block scope. This means that they can only be accessed from within the block of code in which they are declared.
        </h4>
        <h3>Const</h3>
    <h4>

        Variables declared with const also have block scope. Additionally, const variables cannot be reassigned.
        </h4>

        <h1>Use cases of null & undefined</h1>
        <h3>Use cases of null</h3>

            <p>To indicate that a variable does not have a value. For example, you might assign null to a variable that represents the current user if the user is not logged in. <br> <br>
            To clear the value of a variable. For example, you might assign null to a variable that represents the selected item in a list when the user clicks on the clear <br><br>
            To represent the absence of a value in a database or other data store. For example, a database record might have a null value for the address field if the user has not entered their address yet.</p>
            <h3>Use cases of undefined</h3>

            <p>Use cases of undefined

                To indicate that a variable has not been assigned a value. For example, a variable might be undefined if it is declared in a function but never assigned a value. <br><br>
                To indicate that a function does not have a return value. <br><br>
                To represent the absence of a property on an object. For example, an object might not have a name property if it represents a new user who has not yet entered their name.</p>
                <h1>What is Rest API</h1>
                <p>REST API stands for Representational State Transfer API. It is a type of API that conforms to the REST architectural style. REST is a set of principles that define how data should be exchanged over the internet.

                    REST APIs are typically designed to be used by other software applications, rather than by humans directly. They are often used to build web applications, mobile applications, and other types of software.</p>
